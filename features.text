### OwoDaily Features Overview

Based on the official OwoDaily website (owodaily.com) and related resources, OwoDaily is a Nigerian-based marketplace platform that connects businesses with micro-workers, affiliates, and shoppers through micro-jobs, cashback deals, and bounty rewards. It operates as a CPA (Cost Per Action) network, where advertisers pay for verified actions, workers earn from completing jobs, and admins manage the ecosystem. The platform has been paying out millions weekly since 2020, with features tailored to each role.

Below, I'll break down the key features for **Advertiser**, **Worker**, and **Admin** roles, based on the site's documentation, FAQ, and app descriptions. Features are focused on core functionalities like job posting, earning, verification, and management.

#### Features as an Advertiser (Business Owner/Brand)
Advertisers use OwoDaily to promote products, services, or social media presence by posting micro-jobs or bounties. You pay only for verified results, making it a low-risk way to drive engagement and sales.

- **Job Posting & Targeting**:
  - Post micro-jobs or bounties for jobs like social media promotion (e.g., likes, shares, follows on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube), app testing, surveys, or content engagement.
  - Target workers by country, category (e.g., social, bounty, field jobs), sub-category, gender, and more to reach the right audience.
  - Set minimum payouts per sub-category to attract quality workers (e.g., higher pay for complex jobs).

- **Verification & Approval**:
  - Define step-by-step job instructions and required proof (e.g., screenshots, custom verification codes, questions only completers would know).
  - Choose self-approval (moderate submissions via "My jobs" page) or hire OwoDaily for automated verification.
  - Enable bounty mode for performance-based campaigns with automatic code delivery or creative demos for validation.

- **Campaign Management**:
  - Track submissions, approve/reject proofs, and pay only for successful actions.

- **Task Discovery & Earning**:
  - Browse micro-jobs in categories like social media (e.g., promote deals, listen/follow on Spotify), bounty (e.g., sales challenges), field jobs (e.g., distribute flyers), or research (e.g., surveys, app testing).
  - Complete jobs with step-by-step instructions (e.g., share a post and earn ₦30–₦15,000 per job).
  - Unlock high-paying bounties as you build reputation (e.g., drive sales for commissions).

- **Cashback & Rewards**:
  - Activate cashback on shopping deals from top brands—buy online, get real cash (not points) starting from ₦1000 after verification.
  - Redeem rewards via unique codes in the app, turning everyday shopping into income.

- **Submission & Payout**:
  - Submit proof (e.g., screenshots, photos) for verification—jobs are reviewed for quick approval.
  - Get paid weekly (every Friday) for verified earnings, with a minimum withdrawal of ₦1000.

Admins (OwoDaily staff or super-users) manage the marketplace, ensuring smooth operations, verification, and growth. This role is internal but involves platform-wide tools for moderation and analytics.

- **Platform Management**:

  - Investigate claims (e.g., unresolved cashback) and issue refunds if valid.

- **Security & Compliance**:
